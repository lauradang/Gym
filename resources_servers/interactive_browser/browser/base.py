"""Backend-neutral contracts for the interactive-browser environment.

`BrowserBackend` is the whole surface the resources server depends on: how a
browser is obtained, driven and released is entirely the backend's business.
`BrowserSessionProvider` is the second, narrower seam — it exists only for
remote backends, which need someone to hand them a CDP endpoint and take it
back afterwards (see `remote_cdp.py`).
