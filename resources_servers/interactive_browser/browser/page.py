"""Page driving and lifecycle shared by every Playwright-connected backend.

This is an implementation detail, not the abstraction boundary: a local
Chromium and a remote CDP browser differ only in how the browser is obtained,
so observe/click/type/goto and teardown live here once. A backend that does not
speak CDP at all (a vendor SDK with its own DOM API, say) implements
`BrowserBackend` directly and ignores this module.
