"""Example remote provider: isolated cloud browsers from Lexmount.

Reference implementation of `BrowserSessionProvider` against a hosted browser
service — the browser runs off the training node and is reached over CDP. The
SDK is an optional dependency: nothing here is imported unless the config
selects `session_provider: {lexmount: ...}`.

Read `README.md` in this directory before running it at training concurrency.
