"""One contract, run against every shipped backend.

Needs NO GPU and NO Gym serving stack — it proves the hardest part (real browser
automation + compact observation + the state reward scoring reads) works, and
that a locally-launched browser and one reached over CDP behave identically.
Run with:

    uv run --with playwright --with pytest --with pytest-asyncio python -m pytest tests -q
